	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

<p>Time complexity is a concept in computer science that measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. An algorithm is said to be efficient if it has a low time complexity, meaning it can handle large inputs without taking an excessive amount of time to execute.</p>

<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm as a function of the size of the input. It is often denoted as O(n), where n represents the size of the input. Managing space efficiently is crucial in optimizing algorithms for memory usage.</p>

<p>In summary, understanding both time and space complexity is essential for designing and analyzing efficient algorithms.</p>
